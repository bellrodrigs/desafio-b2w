## Project Proposal

This project is based on the challenge of the B2W company, whose purpose was to create a pokemon store, with ReactJs.

The project will be temporarily available at the URL: [PokeStore](https://pokestore-b2w.herokuapp.com/)

## Development

Step 1: Clone the repository
```sh
$ git clone <url repository>
```

Step 2: Install the dependencies
```sh
$ yarn install
```
or
```sh
$ npm install
```

Step 3: Run the Project
```sh
$ yarn start
```
or
```sh
$ npm start
```

If the default browser does not take you directly to the address the project is running on, go to [React on Localhost](http://localhost:3000)

## Tests

After following all the steps of 'Development', to test the application, just use the command:
```sh
$ yarn test
```
or
```sh
$ npm test
```
